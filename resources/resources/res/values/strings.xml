If you participate in the product testing program for Avatar Calling, we (Meta Platforms, Inc.) will collect and use information about you as described in this Privacy Notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Information we use to make the Avatar Calling feature work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use Avatar Calling, we need to make sure that your avatar appears where your face would appear and that it mimics your facial expressions and movements in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we estimate the location of parts of your face (like your eyes, nose, or mouth) and points on your face. We then apply the points to a generic model of a face and adjust it to mimic your facial expressions and movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information is not used to identify you. It is used only to provide the Avatar Calling feature during your WhatsApp video call. When you stop using the feature, we stop processing the information at that time. The information is not retained or shared with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other information we use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may also use information about your use of the Avatar Calling feature, such as how often you use it or whether you use it for the full duration of a given call, to understand how you use the feature, to troubleshoot, diagnose and fix problems that you may have in using the feature, and to improve the feature. This other information will be disassociated from your account, and deleted when we no longer need it to provide or improve the Avatar Calling feature.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
